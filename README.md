# Ξ VS Code Theme

/*

*/

// After a few hackathons being asked what vscode theme I was using, I decided to make it official, fork my favorite one,
// synthwave-x-fluoromachine and customize it fully. https://github.com/webrender/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.
// To find this theme in search ethvscode or 'ethvscode', 'ce9e' for the utf-8 of Ξ.

### Installation

• install this theme  
• install [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css)  
• link the CSS file from this extension in your vscode settings.json:

```javascript
On Mac it might look something like the snippet below:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/ethvscode/ethvscode.css"
    ]
}

Windows might resemble:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/ethvscode/ethvscode.css"
    ]
}
```

• From the command panel, select `Reload Custom CSS and JS`. You'll need to run this command every time vscode updates.
